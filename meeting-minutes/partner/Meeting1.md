# Partner Meeting 1: Mon 2022-09-26 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM
We (Josiah and Cameron) had a joint meeting with partner and the other team (team 27) working on this project.  

# Division of Work
Partner said it was up to us (the two teams) to decided division of labour.   
The other team didn't want to decide the division, but we assumed that they don't want to collaborate. 
Further, we decided that we don't want to collaborate as well.  

# Expectations
- After the semester is over: Partner hopes to be able to publish an alpha and test with users
- Partner prefers a more robust and usable MVP than something that's incomplete with a lot of wishlist items.

## Wishlist Items
- Web-based platform that connects to the mobile versions 
- Built-in payment system
- Bargaining system - a modified version of eBay's offer best price function
- User authentication - similar to AirBnb to make sure they're not bots/scammers
- Item validation - validating that the lost item found is indeed going back to the owner
- Lost/found matching based on description/photo processing
- Scoreboard/user rating/review system to encourage usage
etc.

# Licensing
- No open-source code, not published publicly.
