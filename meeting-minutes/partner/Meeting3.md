# Partner Meeting 3: Sun 2022-10-16 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM
We (Josiah, Aditya, and Cameron) had a meeting with the partner.

## Discussion
- Presented Kelvinâ€™s (ukai18) low-fi prototype

## Partner Feedback on Frontend prototype
- Liked the radius slider
- Wants pins of listings on a Map
- Liked the Save Draft for offline listing creation
    - post later when online
- Wanted current location to be added automatically to new listing
- Wanted post history to go under profile of user
- Hamburger Menu should have Your Profile, Settings, etc.
- No strong preference if map is visible on start
- Map pins open expanded view onPress
- "set location as default" checkbox  
- Add Edit or delete existing post
- In first prototype, experiment to see if gallery view or list view is better for listings screen

## Feedback from Our Team
- Make listings horizontal across screen
- Keep large listings for readability and dexterity
- Edit/Create listing page should resemble more closely the preview/confirmation screen
- Confirmation screen preview-listing component can be reused for visitng listing
- Edit radius button should be on the Map display instead of its own screen
    - Edit location can switch to Map Screen
- Listing views should toggle between Map and Text listings

### Options for Settings Menu
- Change default location
- Theme (dark/light)
- Customizing personal info visibility (phone number vs email, etc.)
